# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The code can be confirmed fuctional and secure by performing various tests such as Junit tests. Dynamic and static testing are some of the many tests that can be used to ensure the code is running correctly.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The best way to interpret the users needs is by having them list out their requirements on a program, asking them detailed questions along the way to ensure everything they want in understood and incorporated. After getting this information, the development team can work together in how these requirements can be completed most effectively and efficiently.

# How do I approach designing software?
Software development should be approached by putting the customers needs first, implementing their requirements into the software, then testing and ensuring the code is bug free. Meeting the deadline is one thing, but at the end of the day bug and error free code is the goal.
